## Keyboard Shortcuts

Since <LogoAsText /> is focused around note taking that is unaccounted for by other note taking software, there are many inputs that are designed to allow you, the user, to insert less common content like math, code or colors.

Many of these less common inputs use a `Cmd-Shift-Enter` keyboard shortcut to conditionally display hidden features that would otherwise crowd the UI. The code block input for example, will open a full screen modal with a full IDE, allowing much more familiar code input in a very VS Code like environment.

Two other keyboard shortcuts include a command palette available by pressing `Cmd-Shift-P`, and when inside of a mdx note, a note summary available by pressing `Cmd-Shift-K`.
