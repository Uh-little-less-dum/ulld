### About the installation

The installation process described here only needs to be undertaken once. Once your app is built, future builds can be configured from this initial build using the existing configuration file. You do not need to reinstall everything from scratch or run the build script every time your notes change. Once your application is compiled, simply creating new files of the file types that are supported by <LogoAsText /> inside of the directory you've added to your <LogoAsText /> configuration file will update your notes automatically, and clicking a single **sync** button available from anywhere within your app will update your database to include your new notes in seconds.

My own workflow related to <LogoAsText /> went like this:
1. Create a new file of whichever <LogoAsText /> supported file type I needed.
2. Click the `sync` button initially so <LogoAsText /> can add that note to the search results.
3. Navigate to that note, and simply refresh the browser every time I wanted to view an updated version of my note. Because <LogoAsText /> does not pull any data from remote sources, this refresh should be almost instant. To follow changes to the note on your file system closely, make sure to turn on the **Prefer File System** option from the command palette from within your app for this rapid updating to take effect. This is off by default for a small boost to performance, but turning this option on will tell <LogoAsText /> to avoid the database for everything that doesn't absolutely require interaction with the database, and will instead choose to read directly from your file system.

While it's a good practice to sync your notes often, even the **sync** button really only _needs_ to be used everytime a note is added; not when a note is changed.

### Environment
For now, <LogoAsText /> runs only in the browser with an accompanying **Node** back end. In time, a companion mobile application will be released for both Android and iOS, and if user's collectively determine that a native desktop app is preferable, a native desktop application as well.


## Installing <LogoAsText fontSize={24} />

<Admonition title="The Build Process" type="info">
This build process will remain under active development. With time, there will likely be an option for installing <LogoAsText /> via a single container that will house all of the necessary steps described here. That however, would not be without it's own drawbacks, so the build cli will be updated regularly. Make sure to update the `@ulld/build` package regularly, ideally before every update of <LogoAsText /> itself.

### Review

If you are unfamiliar with **JSX** syntax, review the [Intro to jsx](/docs/user/introToJsx) article. **JSX** is an incredibly simple syntax that allows you to insert complete React components directly in your markdown notes, and is at the core of <LogoAsText /> functionality..

    </Step>

    <Step>

### Configure

    Configure your application using either the configuration form [here](/configure), or by writing your own [`appConfig.ulld.json`](#write-own-config)

<Admonition title="Important" type="warn" dropdown open footer={
`There are some useful cli commands that can help with this process documented [here](/docs/user/cli).`
}>
The online configuration form will handle all of the core options of your `appConfig.ulld.json` file, but it does not cover everything. There are many more options that can be set for a more refined application using the types exported from the `@ulld/configschema` package, but there is one value that you <Hl yellow>absolutely must</Hl> set on your own: `fsRoot`.

The `fsRoot` field is a single field of type `string` at the base of your `appConfig.ulld.json` file that points to a directory anywhere on your computer that houses all of your notes. This must be set before the build takes place to properly gather information about your file system. This directory is really the only directory you'll have to interact with once your app is compiled until you choose to update or rebuild your application. All of your mdx, notebook, bib and other content files should go in this directory.

The `appConfig.ulld.json` file also accepts `bibPath` and `cslPath` fields, which can be used to point to a `.bib` and `.csl` file with a path that is ***relative*** to the `fsRoot` path. The `bibPath` field defaults to `/citations.bib` and the `cslPath` field is optional. 

If you have a `citations.bib` file inside of the directory pointed to by your `ULLD_ADDITIONAL_SOURCES` variable, a file and path will be automatically generated for you.

There is a repository of every csl format you could ever want available <StaticLink link="links.docs.external.cslRepo">here</StaticLink>. Any of those files be placed in the root of your `ULLD_ADDITIONAL_SOURCES` directory with any file name, as long as it ends with a `.csl` extension. If that file is present, you can ignore this field as a path and file will be automatically generated for you.

### Setup your computer

If you do not have **Node.js** installed, install the specific _stable_ build for your operating system by clicking [here](https://nodejs.org)[^1] <LogoAsText /> works as an entire full-stack application, all on your own computer. This means that a locally running server is required, and for that, <LogoAsText /> uses **Node.js**. Because of the safety limitations within browsers and their intentional lack of access to the file system, any application of this type would not be able to function without a locally running server.

##### Package Managers
<Small muted noMargin><span className="font-bold text-primary">TLDR:</span> Use pnpm for now.</Small>

Package managers are pieces of software that make it much easier to install, locate and update packages for a given environment. For Node, there are three popular package managers.

When you install Node, you'll automatically install a package manager called `npm` as well. There are two other popular alternatives to `npm` that do exactly the same thing in a _usually_ more efficient manner, `pnpm` and `yarn`. <Ul yellow>Eventually</Ul>, <LogoAsText /> will support all three package managers. The code is in place, but as of now, the only package manager that has been thoroughly tested is `pnpm`.

If you are starting from an environment without Node or a Node package manager installed, the easiest way to accomplish this is to download Node, and use `npm` to install `pnpm` by running the following command in your terminal.

```zsh
npm install --global pnpm
```

You will now have access to the `pnpm` command directly, which the <LogoAsText /> cli will use to install dependencies needed to complete the build of your application based on your configuration file.

    </Step>

    <Step>

### Tell <LogoAsText fontSize={18} /> where to find the configuration file.

This can be done in 1 of 2 ways, but please make things easy on yourself and use the first method unless you have good reason to use the second.

First, you can create a directory anywhere on your computer that follows the file structure described [here](/docs/user/extendingTheBuild), and point to that directory with an env variable `ULLD_ADDITIONAL_SOURCES`. 

On a mac, that would look like this:

```zsh title="~/.zshrc"
export ULLD_ADDITIONAL_SOURCES="/path/to/my/directory"
```

And on windows, you'll have to follow the docs [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/shell/creating-profiles?view=powershell-7.4). This approach will allow the core app files to exist separately from the compiled app, ensuring that they remain available during rebuilds and updates.

Alternatively, you can run the build cli and wait for it to pause when it can't find the `appConfig.ulld.json` file. If the cli cannot find the configuration file, it will pause and give you the opportunity to drop the `appConfig.ulld.json` file into the directory that the cli creates. 

The downside to this approach however, is that this configuration file will be overwritten if it is not saved elsewhere when the app is updated or rebuilt.

    </Step>
    <Step>
### Configure Postgres [#get-started-postgres]

<LogoAsText /> will eventually support two different databases; **SQLite** and **Postgres**. Postgres is strongly preferred for performance reasons, but both Postgres and SQLite offer their own unique advantages. For now however, only **Postgres** is officially supported. Unfortunately, **Postgres** requires some additional setup by you, the user. If you intend to store your data on your own machine, as most users will, you'll need to install the postgres server on your machine as well.

To install postgres, visit their installer page [here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/). 

After installing postgres, you'll need to create a database specifically for <LogoAsText />. This can be done through the command line using the `createdb` command as documented [here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-createdb.html), or through a graphical interface like the free and open source **pgAdmin** tool available for download [here](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/).

You will need to provide <LogoAsText /> with two environment variables used to provide a connection url for your database, `ULLD_POSTGRES_URL` and `ULLD_POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING`. While they both are required, when using a local postgres instance these will most likely have the same value. 

Unlike the `ULLD_ADDITIONAL_SOURCES` environment variable, these variables will most likely be specific to your application. To create env variables that are applied specifically to your generated application, you can create a file called `.env` (notice the leading period) in the root of the directory pointed to by your `ULLD_ADDITIONAL_SOURCES` variable.

If you use the **pgAdmin** tool, you'll be able to find the connection url directly through their interface. If you create your database through the cli however, you'll need to format your own connection url using the format documented [here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING). 

When this is all put together, you'll have something like this:


```zsh title="~/.zshrc"
export ULLD_ADDITIONAL_SOURCES="/path/to/my/directory"
```

```json title="/path/to/my/directory/appConfig.ulld.json"
{
    "fsRoot": "/path/to/my/notes/directory",
    ...
}
```

```zsh title="/path/to/my/directory/.env"
ULLD_POSTGRES_URL="postgresql://myUserName:somePassword@localhost:5432/myUlldDatabaseName"
ULLD_POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING="postgresql://myUserName:somePassword@localhost:5432/myUlldDatabaseName"
```

Whew... I know that's a lot, but you're now all set to generate your app.
    </Step>

    <Step>
The last step of this process will be handled almost entirely by the <LogoAsText /> cli. All you need to do is install it, using `npm`, `pnpm`, or `yarn`.

<TabGroup>
    <Tab label="npm">
        `npm install --global @ulld/build`
    </Tab>

    <Tab label="pnpm">
        `pnpm add --global @ulld/build`
    </Tab>

    <Tab label="yarn">
        `yarn install --global @ulld/build`
    </Tab>
</TabGroup>

Once you've installed the build cli using the command above you'll have access to the `ulld` command. For right now the `@ulld/build` package exposes only two commands, `build` and `run`, which can be executed as `ulld build` and `ulld run`.

For more information and to see the available options, use the `ulld` command without any other arguments. You can also see more detailed help for any command with the `ulld help <cmd>`, or in practice, `ulld help build` or `ulld help run`.

**Note:** If you are executing this command against a new database, you'll want to include the `ulldBuild --genDatabase` flag. This will format your database to match the <LogoAsText /> data structure. Be careful however to not include this flag against future builds using the same database, as it may modify the database in a manner that is not recoverable.

If you are unsure of how to find the folder you would like to place the project in from within the terminal, do a quick Google search for 'change directory' on your specific operating system. On a mac, you can also right clock on the folder in Finder and select `Services > New Terminal Tab at Folder`. Remember to select the folder that the project should be _inside of_. Do not create a folder specifically for <LogoAsText />, as the build cli will take care of that for you. For example, if you run the `ulldBuild` command from within the `/Users/myUserName/myRandomStuff` directory, the generated app will exist in a newly created `/Users/myUserName/myRandomStuff/ulldApp` directory.

    </Step>

</Steps>



## That's It!

I know that's a lot more complicated than installing a regular application, but building the app in this format will allow <LogoAsText /> to grow endlessly, as the learning curve for developers to contribute is near zero.

You can now run your project with `ulld run`. 

<Hint note>
    For those with development experience, note that the `ulld run` command is just a utility to execute the `start` script in the compiled app's `package.json` file from any directory.
</Hint>

```zsh
alias myConvenientAlias="pnpm run start --dir /path/to/my/app/ulldApp"
```



<Admonition title="Future Builds" type="note">
    This build process will become significantly improved over the coming weeks and months. Under normal circumstances, I wouldn't even release this application until a better build process was in place, but because of my current living situation, the heat, and my sweet, sweet puppy, I'm unable to work for more than a few hours each day until my battery dies. Once that is taken care of, or even in small increments in the mean time, a significantly improved build process is my main focus.
</Admonition>

### Optional: Writing your own configuration file [#write-own-config]

If you choose to write your own configuration file, follow the `AppConfigSchemaOutput` type exported from `@ulld/configschema/types`. That same module also exports a zod object, `appConfigSchema` from the `@ulld/configschema/zod/main` path that can be used to generate a more complete `AppConfigSchemaOutput` type with sensible defaults, however you must at least fulfill the `AppConfigSchemaInput` type and then write the output to an `appConfig.ulld.json` file. That would look something like this:

```tsx /TODO:/
import fs from 'fs'
import path from 'path'
import {appConfigSchema, AppConfigSchemaInput} from "@ulld/configschema/zod/main"

// TODO: Change this to wherever you are storing the application or to 
// where your ULLD_ADDITIONAL_SOURCES variable points to.
const target = "/Users/bigsexy/ulld/appConfig.schema.json" 

const myConfig: AppConfigSchemaInput = {
    fsRoot: "/Users/bigsexy/Desktop/notes", // Yes... my real home directory. Self confidence is important.
    ...
}

fs.writeFileSync(target, JSON.stringify(myConfig, null, 4), { encoding: "utf-8" })

console.log(`Your app config was written to ${target}!`)

```

<Hint>
    Make ***sure*** to set the `fsRoot` value to the root of your <Ul yellow>notes</Ul>; not the root of your compiled application. This allows the you to have a folder that is dedicated only to your notes, not one that is complicated by an additional application.
</Hint>




[^1]: **Node.js** is a popular _run time_ that allows Javascript, a language that was intended to run inside of browser environments, to be executed on the server. <LogoAsText fontSize={13} />, along with many other applications, relies on a locally running server instance for interacting with it's internal database. <LogoAsText fontSize={13} /> does not contact any outside service or remote database if your application does not specifically set a database connection url to a remote instance, and if your application does not provide credentials for a third party service like Google Calendar.
