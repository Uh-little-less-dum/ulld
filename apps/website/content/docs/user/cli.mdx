The `@ulld/build` package contains the primary cli used to generate a complete <LogoAsText /> application. In most cases, apart from Node and Postgres, that is all you will need to install to generate your application, as everything else will be installed automatically.


## Commands

### build

This is the core build command that will generate a complete <LogoAsText /> application. To learn more about this command and the options that it accepts, run 

```zsh
ulld help build
```

Or to build your application, run 

```zsh
ulld build
```

If you are running this against a ***new*** database, use the `genDatabase` flag to properly format your database. Be _very_ careful to not run this against an existing database, as it may make some or all of the existing data unusable.

To build your application while formatting an _empty_ database, run

```zsh
ulld build --genDatabase
```

### run

This is a utility method to execute the `start` script inside of your generated app's `package.json` file from any directory. You can easily replace this command with an alias of your own executing this same script.

### setJsonSchema

If you chose to generate your app using the `ULLD_ADDITIONAL_SOURCES` environment variable (you should have), this command will set a `$schema` path in the `appConfig.ulld.json` file inside of this directory to a local file path to enable autocompletion inside of most IDEs.

If you are new to editing these types of files, VS Code from Microsoft is a great free, very powerful IDE that can do wonders to help you more quickly and reliably edit pretty much every file type you'll use while working with <LogoAsText />.
