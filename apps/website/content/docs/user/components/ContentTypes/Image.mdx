### EmbeddedImageProps

The Image component extends the html img element with a bunch of style utilities and the ability to more easily utilize images on your local file system without needing to copy or move them.


<Hint>
    Make sure to checkout the `FigRef` component [here](/docs/user/components/Referencing/FigRef) to reference figures within your notes dynamically.
