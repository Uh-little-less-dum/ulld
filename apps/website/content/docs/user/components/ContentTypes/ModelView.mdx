title: ModelView

The ModelView component supports embedding gltf files directly in your note, with support for AR on some devices.

#### Example

```mdx
<ModelView url="/assets/models/Ring.glb" width={300} />
```

### Output


<Hint note>
 This component is currently running into version issues when deploying remotely. I'm doing my best to resolve this soon, but it runs without error when running locally, and will be available on day 1.
