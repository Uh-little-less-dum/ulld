title: Card
---


A card is a component commonly used to assign an optional title and description to a subset of a note's content. It is in some ways similar to an admonition, but in most themes is more muted in it's appearance. As with other comonents, all content properties can include markdown.


```tsx
<Card
title="This is a card"
desc="Cards are a great way to group parts of your note."
>
The _axis of evil_ is a term used to describe the alignment of a set of anisotropies of our cosmic microwave background, as they mysteriously appear to align with the orientation of our solar system.
</Card>
```


#### Output

<Card
title="This is a card"
desc="Cards are a great way to group parts of your note."
>

The _axis of evil_ is a term used to describe the alignment of a set of anisotropies of our cosmic microwave background, as they mysteriously appear to align with the orientation of our solar system.

</Card>
