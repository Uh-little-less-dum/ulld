title: Admonition
---


An admonition is usually used to draw attention to a specific subset of your content. The primary content is passed in as [a child](/docs/user/introToJsx), but quite a few additional properties are available to configure the layout and appearance of the admonition as well. Both the title and footer can contain markdown, but be sure to escape your backslashes by adding another backslash. As mentioned in the [intro to jsx](/docs/user/introToJsx) documentation, this is a limitation of javascript as a whole, and applies to most programming languages where a backslash is required inside of a string.
