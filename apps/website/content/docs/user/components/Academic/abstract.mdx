<Abstract>
While Einstein revolutionized our understanding of space and time, experimental evidence only supports the fact that the fundamental identity $d=vt$ is broken at relativistic velocities, not that time itself dilates. Dilating space according to $\gamma$ as opposed to time not only maintains all of special relativity's experimental validations, but provides a mechanism for the equivalence principle and yields multiple directly observed quantities, all while maintaining synchronicity between reference frames.
