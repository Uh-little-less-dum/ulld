Right now there are four <LogoAsText /> specific events that you can hook into as a developer.

- `onBuild`
- `onRestore`
- `onSync`
- `onBackup`


All of these methods are available in your `pluginConfig.ulld.json` file, and of course in the `developerConfigSchema` exported from `@ulld/configschema/developer`. They are optional strings that align with a export field in your plugin's `package.json` file. Like other fields that align with the export property, the function must be exported as that file's **default** export. 

Because some of these methods accept any json serializable object, and will return that same type in another method, it is recommended that you type these methods using the uniform `EventMethods` type exported from `@ulld/configschema/types`. That typing approach might look like:

```tsx
import { EventMethods as EMS, EventMethod as EM } from "@ulld/configschema/types"
import { PluginEventsConfig } from "@ulld/types"

type SyncData = {
    myData: string
    myOtherData: number // etc...
}

export type EventMethods = EMS<SyncData>

export type EventMethod<K extends keyof PluginEventsConfig> = EM<SyncData, K>
```

The above approach will ensure type safety across the different methods, as the `SyncData` type will be serialized using **superjson**[^1] in the `onBackup` method, and then returned during the `onRestore` method.

The intended function of these events are as follows:

1. `onBackup`
    - All generated returned from this function will be serialized using **superjson** and stored in a local json file.
2. `onRestore`
    - This is the other half of `onBackup`. This method will be given the same data that was provided returned by the `onBackup` method, and it is up to you the developer to store it in their database (make sure to check that you are not storing duplicates) and generate any necessary changes that their data might indicate.
3. `onBuild`
    - This method is called once during the build process, after the core of the build is in place. This method receives 3 arguments, an object containing a set of paths as the `PathMap` type[^4], their validated `AppConfigSchemaOutput`[^2], and their generated `BuildStaticDataOutput`[^3]. These paths will be the absolute path to various directories and files in that user's new application. This is your opportunity to copy over any data you might need to their public folder, generate a static json file, or create a `scss` file base on their configuration file. Keep in mind, static json files can be changed after app is compiled, but those changes will ***not*** be reflected in the user's application until their app is rebuilt. It is only realistic to create file content directly in the user's file system if that content will not change over the period with which they user their application.
4. `onSync`
   - This method is likely the most important of the currently available methods. This method will be given an array of `MdxNote` classes and expect you, the developer, to gather whatever information is needed and store it in that user's database.


[^1]: This means that objects like `Date`, `RegExp`, `Map`, `Set` and even `Error` classes are supported, but functions are not.
