<LogoAsText /> includes a rather extensive **TRPC** router for both the server and client. Interaction with the database directly should be avoided, and instead rely upon the trpc router for all data interactions.

## Give me a second...

This router is quite large, and it will take me a bit to document everything. <LogoAsText /> should be launching in July, and I will do my best to have this documentation in place by the end of August.  

In the mean time, if you want to build a plugin that requires access to this router, reach out through the contact methods elsewhere on the <LogoAsText /> website and I will do my best to push your needs up to the front of the to-do list.
