## Reckless youth

As a kid, I spent countless nights walking around well into the early morning, just staring up at the sky. I often slept at the park, just amazed at the vastness and the scale of space, with this deep, growing sense of awe and wonder.

It was then, in 6th grade when the first of a series of events that would forever change my outlook on life occurred. I won't bother the reader with the details, but I remember exactly where I was. I was walking back from our science classroom, in the corner of the basement of my middle school. I didn't know it then, but the following moments would set me up for an experience that would later change me forever.  

I went through life more or less as normal through the following years. I was always a little bit more of a risk taker than most, and I had a world view that was quite a bit different from my peers fueled by that experience in the 6th grade, but overall it was just the normal teenage years of an aimlessly rebellious youth.

## My Inspiration

It wasn't until I was 21 that I had another experience that would change my life forever. If what happened in middle school was a gentle nudge towards the path that I'm now on, this was like getting hit by a bus. After this experience I began to isolate, probably to the point of being detrimental. I had an incredibly large and diverse group of friends to this point, but all of a sudden the things we enjoyed together meant nothing to me. I didn't isolate out of a sense of depression or anxiety, but rather out of a sense of curiosity, as strange as that may sound.

With this second experience, I went from being uninterested in money and wealth to a complete unwillingness to spend my life working for nothing more than a paycheck and playing a role in making rich people richer at the expense of everyone else. I knew I had to do something impactful, something to play even the smallest role in getting this world back on track, and I was going to follow that pursuit no matter what the cost.

It wasn't until February 15th, 2021 that things started to make sense, and in some ways, make less sense than ever. The dots were finally getting connected, but where they led left me with more questions than answers. It was almost as if I got a glimpse into the inner workings of time and space, and wasn't capable of making sense of it. I spent the next year and a half with this incredible burning sense of wonder, with an almost desperation to understand how things truly worked. 

I couldn't focus on my work as a developer, taking on as little work as I could to pay my bills while spending every free minute reading over paper after paper. Everything from 19th century publications to the latest cosmology journals, even going over 6th century BCE writings by the most brilliant minds of the time. I was desperately seeking anything capable of offering a new perspective on the nature of time and space.

## The epiphany

And then one night, sitting at my counter in the early morning hours waiting for my toaster to pop out my bed time snack, I opened a book I had sitting just beside me. I wasn't planning on doing any more research for the night, but if I was going to be awake for another 30 minutes, why not make the most of that time?

That book was _On the relativity principle and the conclusions drawn from it_[@Einstein_equivelance_principle]; a collection of Einstein's work. I wasn't planning on being up much longer, as it was already well into the morning hours, so I just picked a page hoping to find where the lengthy introduction ended.

I had already read this book and most of the papers in it a half a dozen times, but this time something stood out to me. Maybe it was my lack of sleep that made me more willing to entertain ideas that were less obvious, or maybe it was the fact that it had already been over a year without the answers I was after, but there it was:

<Quote author="Albert Einstein">
    According to the Principle of Relativity, the length found out by operation a), which we may call "the length of the rod in the moving system" is equal to the length $l$ of the rod in the stationary system.
</Quote>

What if that is not true? The equation $d=vt$ is so symmetrical, that all of the validations of relativity can be accounted for by applying that dilation to space and not time. Einstein was insistent on a static Universe when he wrote _On the electrodynamics of moving bodies_, the paper that gave us what we now call special relativity, but we now know that the Universe is expanding; we can measure it. Would it not be more sensical to consider that it is perhaps space that dilates with relative motion, and not a medium that we can't directly measure? Should we really apply this observable dilation to a medium in which we can't determine our rate of change, and then forcefully dilate variables that we can to accommodate?

This hit me like a Warshack test. For so long all I could see was the butterfly, and then all of a sudden I noticed the couple kissing and could never look at the picture the same way again.

## Leaving work

That night I knew I was going to dedicate everything I have to resolving this issue, no matter the cost. I began accepting less work, and only a few weeks later I finished up my last paid work as a developer to pursue this model of relativity without any distractions. I didn't know how I would demonstrate this model and distinguish it from our current interpretation of relativity, but I knew that this was what I needed to be doing. I felt like I had a moral obligation to follow this through to the end.

It was May of 2022 when my lease was up. I knew I wouldn't be able to afford more than another month in this woefully overpriced apartment, so I chose not to renew my lease. I moved everything into a storage locker, only to be unable to afford that just 2 months later.

### The lighthouse

It was the middle of summer, and there was only one place I knew of where I could find shade and a nice breeze. There's an overpass in Milwaukee that goes over the Milwaukee river where it meets Lake Michigan, with a few parking spaces underneath and a small park to the side near the lake.

It was under that overpass where I spent most of my first homeless summer, parked just feet from the Milwaukee river. I spent every day going over the most basic math dozens of times, hoping that I would see a pattern, and then it hit me; simultaneity is the key to this conundrum.

See, when I wasn't staring at my notebook I often day dreamed about what it would be like if the speed of light were on a human scale. As I sat looking over the Milwaukee river, just a few blocks from where I was initially sent down this path, where there were two prominent land marks: a lighthouse and a clock tower.

Milwaukee may not be as big as New York or Chicago, but we do have what was the biggest 4-faced clock tower in the world. I sat and wondered every day what it would be like to travel between those to points, the lighthouse and the clock tower near the speed of light.

### Simultaneity

Then it hit me; what if an observer in motion agreed with an observer at rest to travel at precisely some velocity $v$ between the lighthouse and the clock tower? If they agree upon a velocity, surely that velocity should be equivalent in both reference frames. Velocity after all, $v$ is a variable which the observer can directly manipulate.

If the observer in relative motion travels at an agreed upon velocity that approaches the speed of light between the lighthouse and the clock tower, how can this observer reach the clock tower at a time other than $\frac{d}{v}$? This is no longer a matter of physics alone, but of pure mathematical definition.

We know experimentally that $\gamma$ is applied as a scalar of $t$, but what about this simultaneity? Surely, even if $t^{\prime} = t \gamma$ there must exist a simultaneity that permits the observer in relative motion to reach the clock tower in a time that allows this time dilation while still accommodating the agreed upon velocity.

The only possible way to accomplish this simultaneity while still permitting this experimentally validated dilation of time was to apply this $\gamma$ scalar not to time, but to _distance_. With this scalar applied to distance, to space itself, the observer in relative motion can reach the clock tower in precisely $\frac{d}{v}$. This model however demonstrates something more profound; as time in the frame at relative rest becomes space for the observer in relative motion, the coordinate system, and space itself is less dense in the coordinate system in relative motion. This ***is*** what we currently address as cosmic inflation.
