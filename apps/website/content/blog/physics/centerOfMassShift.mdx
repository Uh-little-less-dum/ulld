 Geometry has two great treasures: one is the Theorem of Pythagoras; the other, the division of a line into extreme and mean ratio. The first we may compare to a measure of gold; the second we may name a precious jewel.

Of course, all physics points to the principle that our location on Earth is in no way special or unique. That however does not mean that we shouldn't study our local reference frame for symmetries that say something greater about the way the Universe works that we would otherwise miss. The so called _Axis of Evil_ is one instance of this which has yet to be resolved. Here, I will present another.

Consider figure <FigRef id="space-dilation-phi"/>, where $dx = v \Delta t$ and $dx^{\prime} = v \Delta t \gamma$. Before Einstein revolutionized our understanding of the Universe, time was believed to be a sort of _'final'_ derivative... a rate of change to which all other rates of change can be compared.

It is my position that it is not time which behaves in this manner, but that time arises in this manner due to our velocity _through_ space, which in turn produces an acceleration towards a spatial system of a lesser density, giving the appearance of a motion _of_ space. If this is true, then velocity _through_ space arises as perhaps the most fundamental quantity; not as $\frac{dx}{dt}$, but as a quantity which on a fundamental level can only be compared to the rate of motion _through_ space of other bodies, as a pure magnitude of sorts.

Given this interpretation of velocity and time, we might review <FigRef id="space-dilation-phi"/> with a loosened dependence on time. If we consider $v$ as a pure magnitude as

$$
\begin{align}
v = \bar{v} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left( 1 + \frac{g}{R} \right)^{2}}} \approx 526.6 ~ \text{km} ~ \text{s}^{-1}
\end{align}
$$

we find 

$$
\begin{align}
\bar{v} \equiv \bar{v} \Delta t = 526.6 ~ \text{km} ~ \text{s}^{-1}
\end{align}
$$

It is my position that $\bar{v}$ should still be considered as a derivative, $dx$, and this magnitude of $526.6 ~ \text{km} ~ \text{s}^{-1}$ be applied only as a dimensionless scalar; as a means of comparison to the speed of light, $c$.

In that light[^1], we should find $ds$ by the following:

$$
\begin{align}
ds = dx^{\prime} - dx = \bar{v} \left( \gamma - 1 \right)
\end{align}
$$


Since for $\delta$ to be applied as a scalar, we must apply it as $\delta + 1$, $\gamma - 1 = \delta$.

This gives

$$
\begin{align}
  ds = \bar{v} \delta = 1.61800 & = \Phi - 3.29 \times 10^{-5} \\
& = \Phi - 0.00203\%
\end{align}
$$


## Interpretation 

As $\delta$ is applied as an integral over $R$ to give $g$, and in turn the spatial dilation proposed to provide a mechanism for the equivalence principle, $\delta$ applied as a scalar must be applied to the center of mass of the body in motion: the Earth.

Given that $c$, $v$ and $ds$ all share the same units, this relationship becomes truly dimensionless. Measuring units of length in Chevy Sonics and units of time in the duration of the most recent Taylor Swift album would yield this same symmetry. This symmetry is lost however if the notion of time is applied in the traditional sense, where velocity is time dependent, rather than time being velocity dependent as $\bar{v}t$ would no longer be equivalent.

This result should not be misinterpreted to imply that the center of mass of the Earth dilates by $1.618$ meters per second, or even $1.618$ meters per distance $\bar{v} dt$. Rather, in a ***truly dimensionless*** relationship:

$$
\begin{align}
 ds ~ dx =  \Phi
\end{align}
$$
