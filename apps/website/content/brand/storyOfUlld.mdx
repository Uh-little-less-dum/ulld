In the first weeks of 2022 while reading over some of Einstein's work for the $\text{n}^{\text{th}}$ time, I came across a geometry that I believe can revolutionize our understanding of gravity and it's relationship to time. I was working as a freelance developer at the time, and almost immediately began to accept less work as I tried to formalize the theory that led to the creation of <LogoAsText />.

It took me only a few weeks to find the first value that coincides with direct observation, our _peculiar velocity_. This particular value however includes significant error margins due to inherent obstacles complicating direct observation, so I set out to find at least one more observation that this model predicts that neither SR, GR or Newtonian mechanics can provide.  


For the first half of this journey I relied on other popular note taking software but became increasingly frustrated. Some apps had reasonable search features, but did not support plots or other content a student or researcher might require, while other apps offered great support for inline calculations and plotting, but offered almost no searchability and linking features at all.  

I not only required the ability to write math, run calculations and generate plots, but also to consolidate my thoughts into a flow that allowed me to pick up any note and be able to easily trace the thoughts that led me to that point. Being a former software engineer, I began to create my own app for personal use. Now that I am confident in the results of my research, I have shifted my focus to making <LogoAsText /> available to everyone, <Ul yellow>_for free_</Ul>.

If you can, please consider supporting the development of <LogoAsText /> by clicking [here](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=W22RTUJ2RPZDU), scanning the QR code below, or through the [sponsor](/sponsor) page, and if you're interested in physics and cosmology, checkout the inspiration for <LogoAsText /> [here](/myWork). <LogoAsText /> was never created to be for sale, but in the pursuit of this theory I became homeless, and as I'm writing this, I don't have a penny to fill up my gas tank so I can run my car to charge my computer to finish the last 3% of preparing <LogoAsText /> for release.
