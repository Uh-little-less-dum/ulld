# Getting Started

<LogoAsText /> functions primarily as an ecosystem of note taking and academic focused React components and a build script to generate a complete web application using all of the most modern technologies, customized to your own configuration. 

<Admonition title="Environment" type="info" sidebar>
 For now, <LogoAsText /> runs only in the browser with an accompanying **Node** backend. In time, a companion mobile application will be released for both Android and iOS, and if user's collectively determine that a native desktop app is preferrable, a native desktop application as well.

## Where to go from here

- If you are unfamiliar with **JSX** syntax, review the [intro to jsx](/docs/user/introToJsx) article.
- Configure your application using either the configuration form [here](/configure), or by writing your own [`appConfig.ulld.json`](#write-own-config)
- If you do not have `Node.js` installed, install the specific _stable_ build for your operating system by clicking [here](https://nodejs.org)[^1]
- While an installer completely independent of **Git** is in the works, for now, the main <LogoAsText /> repo must be cloned using **Git**. Install **Git** by following the instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git), and then use:



<CodeBlock>
    {`git clone [link:links.repo.clone.https]`}
</CodeBlock>


**Node.js** ships with an accompanying package, `npm`, the _Node Package Manager_. A preferable alternative to **npm**, which needs to be installed separately, is **pnpm** or _Performant Node Package Manager_. If you are comfortable installing packages using the terminal, you can install **pnpm** by following the instructions [here](https://pnpm.io/installation).


<TabGroup>
    <Tab label="npm">
        `npm install`
    </Tab>
    <Tab label="pnpm">
        `pnpm add`
    </Tab>
</TabGroup>






### **Optional:** Writing your own configuration file ||write-own-config||

If you choose to write your own configuration file, follow the `AppConfigSchemaOutput` type exported from `@ulld/configschema/zod/main`. That same module also exports a zod object, `appConfigSchema` that can be used to generate a more complete `AppConfigSchemaOutput` type with sensible defaults, however you must at least fulfill the `AppConfigSchemaInput` type and then write the output to an `appConfig.ulld.json` file at the root of the <Ul yellow>application</Ul>. That would look something like this:

```tsx /TODO:/
import fs from 'fs'
import path from 'path'
import {appConfigSchema, AppConfigSchemaInput} from "@ulld/configschema/zod/main"

// TODO: Change this to wherever you are storing the application.
const target = "/Users/bigsexy/ulld/appConfig.schema.json" // Yes... my real home directory. Self confidence is important.

const myConfig: AppConfigSchemaInput = {
    fsRoot: "/Users/bigsexy/Desktop/notes",
    ...
}

fs.writeFileSync(target, JSON.stringify(myConfig, null, 4), { encoding: "utf-8" })

console.log(`Your app config was written to ${target}!`)

```

<Hint>
    Make ***sure*** to set the `fsRoot` key to the root of your <Ul yellow>notes</Ul>; not the root of your compiled application. This allows the application to be stored separately from the notes folder.
</Hint>



[^1]: **Node.js** is a popular _run time_ that allows Javascript, a language that was intended to run inside of browser environments, to be executed on the server. <LogoAsText fontSize={13} />, along with many other applications relies on a locally running server instance for interacting with it's internal database. <LogoAsText fontSize={13} /> does not contact any outside service or remote database if your application does not specifically set a database connection url to a remote instance, and if your application does not provide credentials for a third party service like Google Calendar.
