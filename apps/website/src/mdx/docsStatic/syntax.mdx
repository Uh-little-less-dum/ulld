## Links

### Timestamp Link

You can create links to time stamps of videos on the current page with the following syntax:

```mdx
<Video file="/path/to/my/video.mp4" id="videosUniqueReferenceId" />

As you can see at [4 minutes and 6 seconds](videoLink/videosUniqueReferenceId/1:12) in the video above, the creator of ULLD is incredibly good looking.
```

Note that the time stamp link follows normal markdown link syntax, but is identified internally by the leading `videoLink/...` path. This `videoLink/...` must be immediately followed by the matching unique id of the video you're addressing, and then by the time stamp. The time stamp is in the format of `hours:minutes:seconds` or `minutes:seconds`.

<Hint>
    See the [intro to jsx](/docs/user/introToJsx) documentation for a brief summary of valid ids.
