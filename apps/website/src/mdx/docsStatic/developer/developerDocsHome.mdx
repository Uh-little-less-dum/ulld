# Developer Documentation


<LogoAsText /> supports several types of plugins. Developers can build plugins that integrate with <LogoAsText /> seemlessly and provide one more more of the following features:

- **[Embeddable Components](#devDocs-embeddable-components):** Components that can be embedded in the user's mdx content.
- **[Slot Components](#devDocs-slot-components):** Components that override specific component slots in the user's compiled application.
- **[Parsing Functions](#devDocs-parsing-functions):** Functions that partially parse mdx content _before_ it is rendered to React, adding the ability to create new syntaxes unique to your specific plugin.


## Developer Config Schema

<LogoAsText /> exports a zod object from `@ulld/configschema/developer` as a named export, `developerConfigSchema` as well as a `DeveloperConfigInput` type. <LogoAsText /> also exports a simple utility function, `writePluginConfig` from `@ulld/developer/writePluginConfig`. This approach was taken to allow you, the developer, to ensure that your configuration can be successfully parsed before publishing your plugin to npm. With these exports, a file can be created at the root of your package (this already exists if you clone the developer template) which can then be executed with `ts-node` or `tsx` generate a completely type safe json file named `pluginConfig.ulld.json`, also at the root of your project.

```ts title="<root>/createMyConfig.ts"
import {
    DeveloperConfigInput,
    developerConfigSchema,
} from "@ulld/configschema/developer";
import { writePluginConfig } from "@ulld/developer/writePluginConfig";

const pluginConfig: DeveloperConfigInput = {
    ...
};

const parsedPlugin = developerConfigSchema.parse(pluginConfig);


writePluginConfig(parsedPlugin, __dirname);
```
