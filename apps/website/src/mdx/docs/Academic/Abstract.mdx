### AbstractProps

Takes no properties directly, but can wrap content to add an abstract to mdx content.

#### Example

```tsx
<Abstract>
  While Einstein revolutionized our understanding of time and space,
  experimental evidence only supports the fact that the fundamental identity
  $d=vt$ is broken at relativistic velocities, not that time itself dilates.
  Dilating space according to $\gamma$ as opposed to time not only maintains all
  of special relativities experimental validations, but provides a mechanism for
  the equivalence principle and yields multiple directly observed quantities.
