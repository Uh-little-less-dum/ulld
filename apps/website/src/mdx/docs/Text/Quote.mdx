### QuoteProps

**`Alpha`**

Add a quote with an optional author field to your note.

#### Example

```tsx
<Quote author={"Aristophanes, 4th century BCE"}>
  Love is born into every human being; it calls back the halves of our original
  nature together; it tries to make one out of two and heal the wound of human
  nature. Each of us, then, is a ‘matching half’ of a human whole…and each of us
  is always seeking the half that matches him.
</Quote>
