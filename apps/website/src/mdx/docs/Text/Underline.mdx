## Interfaces

### UnderlineProps

The Underline component is available either as **Underline** or **Ul**. Along with several other components, the underline component takes a color as a boolean property. You can both define new colors and override default colors in your configuration file.

#### Example

```tsx
This is some <Ul>underlined</Ul> <Ul red>red</Ul>, <Ul blue>blue</Ul>, and <Ul green>green</Ul> text.
```

This is some <Ul>underlined</Ul> <Ul red>red</Ul>, <Ul blue>blue</Ul>, and <Ul green>green</Ul> text.

#### Properties

| Property | Type      | Description            |
| :------- | :-------- | :--------------------- |
| `thin?`  | `boolean` | Make underline thinner |
| `thick?` | `boolean` | Make underline thicker |
