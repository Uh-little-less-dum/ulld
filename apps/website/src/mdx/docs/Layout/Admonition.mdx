## Interfaces

### AdmonitionProps

An admonition is usually used to draw attention to a specific subset of your content. The primary content is passed in as [a child](/docs/user/introToJsx), but quite a few additional properties are available to configure the layout and appearance of the admonition as well. Both the title and footer can contain markdown, but be sure to escape your backslashes by adding another backslash. As mentioned in the [intro to jsx](/docs/user/introToJsx) documentation, this is a limitation of javascript as a whole, and applies to most programming languages where a backslash is required inside of a string.

#### Example

```tsx
<Admonition
  title="Mass Equivalency: $e=mc^2$"
  footer="Man that Einstein guy was smart."
  type="info"
  dropdown
>
  Following from the 1905 publication of _On the electrodynamics of moving
  bodies_, Einstein offered a follow up paper, _On the relativity principle and
  the conclusions drawn from it_ in 1907.
</Admonition>
```

#### Output

<Small noMargin muted>
  You can find demos of the other types [here](/demos/attentionGetters)

This has no visible effect on the admonition, but can be used for referencing elsewhere in the app. Some plugins may rely on this property for their functionality if their functionality is intended to reference a specific part of your note.                                                    |
