### EmbeddableCardProps

**`Alpha`**

A card is a component commonly used to assign an optional title and description to a subset of a note's content. It is in some ways similar to an admonition, but in most themes is more muted in it's appearance. As with other comonents, all content properties can include markdown.

#### Example

```tsx
<Card
  title="This is a card"
  desc="Cards are a great way to group parts of your note."
>
  The _axis of evil_ is a term used to describe the alignment of a set of
  anisotropies of our cosmic microwave background, as they mysteriously appear
  to align with the orientation of our solar system.
</Card>
```

#### Output

<Card
  title="This is a card"
  desc="Cards are a great way to group parts of your note."
>
  The *axis of evil* is a term used to describe the alignment of a set of
  anisotropies of our cosmic microwave background, as they mysteriously appear
  to align with the orientation of our solar system.
</Card>
