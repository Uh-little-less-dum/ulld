### CenteredTextProps

**`Alpha`**

A simple utility component to center components and text.

#### Example

```tsx
<Center width={250}>
  This is some centered content. By setting a width, I can force the centered
  content to not extend beyond that width. By using the `muted` property, I can
  make the text take on a muted appearance, and by setting the `noMargin`
  property to be true, I can remove the default margin.
</Center>
```
