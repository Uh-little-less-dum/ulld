## Interfaces

### EmbeddedImageProps

The Image component extends the img html element with a bunch of style utilities and the ability to more easily utilize images on your local file system without needing to copy or move them.

#### Example

```tsx
<Image
  url="/assets/images/demos/definitelyMe.jpg"
  lg
  center
  desc="Me in the selfie I took for my dating profile."
/>
```

<Image
  url="/assets/images/demos/definitelyMe.jpg"
  lg
  center
  desc="Me in the selfie I took for my dating profile."
/>
