<Title subtitle="Well, about just me and my puppy for now.">
    {'About Us'}
</Title>

My name's Andrew, and I'm the creator of <LogoAsText />. I'm a 34 year old, kinda-former software engineer with a background in and a passion for physics. In my former life as a developer I spent much of my freetime at the lakefront in downtown Milwaukee, catching up on the latest physics research. I guess that's the upside of borderline crippling ADHD :laughing:. Before I left my career behind to focus on my own research and building <LogoAsText /> as a personal app, I was pretty content with my life as a developer. I had a small but great, modern apartment in downtown Milwaukee, a great work environment, and the sweetest puppy on Earth. I loved the problem solving and endless learning of software development, but I felt like I needed to contribute more to society.  

It wasn't until one of those life changing events came along that I started to re-evaluate my priorities and question why I was working in a career that only served to make rich people richer. After this once in a lifetime event, I started to focus more on physics than on my own work. I wanted to understand how the Universe works even more desperately than I did before, and I started to rush through projects so I could spend more time reading over different research, hoping to find the missing piece that would make it all make sense. 

## Evolution of the theory of relative spatial dilation

While I can't claim to have found what it takes to make it _"all"_ make sense, I do think I found a significant missing piece that more closely unifies time with gravity, and provides a platform for unifying gravity with electromagnetism within the lifetime of many people reading this. This all occurred late one night, staring out the window after reading over some of Einstein's lectures. The next day I was at the park again, with the latest publications and a notebook in hand. To my left was this lighthouse, where the Milwaukee river meets the shore of Lake Michigan. To my right was a clock tower off in the distance. It suddenly hit me; what if Einstein made an assumption that's incorrect? How can it be that if I tell another person, to travel between the lighthouse and the clock tower at an agreed upon velocity, that that other person would reach the clock tower in a time other than $t = \frac{d}{v}$? This isn't just an equation, this is an identity that follows not from math alone, but from the very nature of our reality. We ***define*** velocity to be proportional to distance and time. While there are many mathematical approaches to resolving the assymmetries produced by both the special and general theories of relativity that have existed for over 100 years, current approaches would either force the velocity according to the person in relative motion to be of a different magnitude to that of the agreed upon velocity, or permit that the person in motion would arrive at the lighthouse at a time greater than $t = \frac{d}{v}$.

<Quote author="Albert Einstein, 'The electrodynamics of moving bodies'">
    In accordance with the principle of relativity the length to be discovered by the operation (a)[^2]—we will call it “the length of the rod in the moving system”— must be equal to the length $l$ of the stationary rod.
</Quote>

Einstein was insistent on a static Universe earlier in his career when he made this assumption, but in the context of cosmic inflation, what if this assumption was wrong? I stayed at work for another couple months, but I just couldn't focus on anything other than this assumption made in special relativity that then carried over to general relativity. Then one day it hit me: If the generalized theory of relativity relies so heavily on the equivalence principle[^1], and Earth's rotation and radius are proportional in such a way that the time dilation due to excess gravity at the poles perfectly offsets the time dilation due to excess velocity at the equator, what if this potential dilation of space ***is*** the source of gravity? Solving Einstein's time dilation factor, $\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}$ for $v$, and then substituting the spacial dilation required to produce our local gravitational acceleration gave me $526.6 ~ \text{km} ~ \text{s}^{-1}$, a value that fits almost perfectly on top of probability curves found through direct observation!  

I immediately began to work on _disproving_ this theoretical geometry, under which motion results in progression along this density axis that we experience as time. It turns out that that's a lot harder than it sounds. Every single experimental validation of the time dilation due to either the specialized or generalized theories of relativity can be accounted for by this relative spatial dilation, and in fact, this spatial dilation arguably offers a much more logical and observationally sound mechanism for these measurements. The generalized theory of relativity relies heavily upon the equivalence principle after all, and what this theoretical geometry does is simply apply the special relativity based time dilation scalar to a spatial dilation scalar of an equivalent magnitude to that of our local gravitational acceleration that the equivalence principle is referring to.  

I knew that if I could prove this theory, to whatever extent a physics theory can be proven, this could change the world by providing a platform for research into clean energy and propulsion systems of a type we haven't yet consider to be possible. What I planned on being a few months away from paid work turned into over 2 years. I became homeless only a couple months after having this epiphany, but I was determined to demonstrate this geometry more concretely. I knew if I could demonstrate this geometry first, I would be able to do something very different with whatever came from it than billionaire operated international corporations would, and I was willing to bet my well being, my health, and even my life on it.  

## Building <LogoAsText fontSize={24} />

Over the course of my research, I became increasingly frustrated with the various note taking options for academics. Jupyter is phenomenal for calculations and simple markdown cells, but it lacked the customizability and search features that I needed. Other apps offered great search and linking features, but also lacked easy customizability and didn't support the STEM specific features a modern student or researcher requires. About half way through this now more than 2 year journey, I gave up with existing options and built my own app. I didn't build it all at once though; I started out with just an mdx app, where I could simply put all of my notes into one folder, and the app would do the rest, but this time with the search and linking features that I needed. Every time I came to a bump in the road where I needed a feature in my notes that I didn't yet support, I could simply build it myself and add that feature to the app. <LogoAsText/> is built with Next.js and React, along with other modern javascript and typescript libraries that most developers are already familiar with. The current rendition runs in the browser, but there are plans to create a mobile app, and eventually a desktop app that can render these same react components in a stand alone application. One of the benefits of running things in the browser is the ease of extensibility for developers _after_ the release of <LogoAsText />, as well as the ability for user's to publish either all of their notes or a subset of their notes on the web in the future. Giving up the stand alone application feel for a more accessible developer experience, to me, was a no brainer. Not only was it the technology that offered me the most rapid development of the application, as I was building it for my own research which was my main focus, it makes the app extensible to more developers than any other modern technology.  

The hopes for <LogoAsText /> are varied, but primarily that <LogoAsText /> becomes a repository for an ever growing collection of mdx components that user's can embed in their notes by simply including the name of the plugin developed by a community of developers in their configuration file. The hopes are that with time, user's can replace or extend the internally developed plotting package with a user developed package that better fits the user's needs or desired design, or that user developed [parsing extensions](/docs/developer/parsingExtensions) add additional functionality that over time grows the user base of <LogoAsText /> to include far more than STEM students and researchers. <LogoAsText /> should be an application in which a user simply adds the names of the extensions they want to include, describes the different types of notes that they want to take in a simple configuration file that can be generated either by the online form available [here](/configure), or written by the user directly in JSON, and a fully built application is generated automatically.


## If you're only here for the app

If you are new to <LogoAsText />, make sure to check out the [getting started](/docs/user) section in our user documentation, and if you're a developer, take a look at the developer specific docs available [here](/docs/developer). There are a few tools that <LogoAsText /> relies on to operate, but these tools are among the most well tested software available today. The _getting started_ section mentioned above should cover all of the steps necessary to take anyone from a brand new computer to a fully functional <LogoAsText /> application in less than 20 minutes.

[^2]: The measurement of the measuring rod by the observer in relative motion. From 'On the electrodynamics of moving bodies':  
    _The observer moves together with the given measuring-rod and the rod to be measured, and measures the length of the rod directly by superposing the measuring-rod, in just the same way as if all three were at rest._
