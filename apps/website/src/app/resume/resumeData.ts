        "I've worked with typescript, React and Node for almost a decade, and have several years of experience with Python as well. I am also proficient with Lua, and although I haven't used it in quite a while, I still enjoy working with Swift when I get the opportunity. I feel like I perform best when Iâ€™m challenged, and I would hope to find that in my next job as well. I studied Physics at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, and in February of 2022 I decided to take time away from my freelance work to write a paper regarding relativity and gravity. The results of the paper that I've spent the past 2+ years working on has turned out to be more physically consistent than I had even hoped, producing at least 2 distinct, observable quantities that are unaccounted for by existing models of relativity. With this chapter now behind me, I'm looking forward to returning to full time work.",
