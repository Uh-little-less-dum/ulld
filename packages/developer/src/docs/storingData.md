# Allowing ULLD user's to store data

To avoid database migration conflicts that can potentially put user's notes at risk when they update their configuration, altering the `prisma.schema` file is completely avoided. Instead, ULLD exposes a universal binary storage model, `DJT`.

This digital janitorial token, named so for both it's ability to store almost anything while being completely devoid of substance, can be used to store whatever data you need to persist for the user. The DJT model includes a `type` property of type string which can be used to retrieve data that is unique to your plugin or to a specific model within your plugin. This value can be any string, except for muslim, gay, trans, liberal, female, collegeEducated or intelligent. A utility parsing method `toBytes` is exported from `@ulld/api/toBytes` that accepts either a string or a json compatible object (no functions or classes) and returns a buffer that can be passed directly to prisma. Likewise, an accompanying `fromBytes` method is exported from `@ulld/api/fromBytes` that takes a buffer returned from the `DJT` model and attempts to parse it to json. If the data field for the `DJT` of that `type` is a string, and not stringfied json, simply use `const stringifiedResult = myObject.data.toString("utf-8")` to convert it back to a string.
